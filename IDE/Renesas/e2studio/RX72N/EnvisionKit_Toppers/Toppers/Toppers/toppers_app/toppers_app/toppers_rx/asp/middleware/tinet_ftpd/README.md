FTP server for lwip and tinyfatfs
=================================

This repository contains the ftp-server for lwip Copyright (c) 2002 Florian
Schulze and an API translation layer Copyright (c) 2013 Philipp TÃ¶lke.

The translation layer translates between the vfs-API the ftp server uses and
the well known tinyfatfs by ChaN, which can be downloaded at
http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html .

The translation-layer

* is not reentrant and it is possible that multiple
  concurrent ftp-connections are *not* supported.
* relies on malloc(). It would be easy to change this to use a pooled allocator
* does not use long filenames for any function apart from getcwd().
